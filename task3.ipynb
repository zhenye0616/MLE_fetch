    "\n",
    "Implications:\n",
    "\n",
    "No adaptation of BERT or heads. NO weights are getting updated.\n",
    "Heads remain untrained (if randomly initialized) → poor task performance unless you’ve already fine‑tuned elsewhere.\n",
    "Zero gradient computation through the model → fastest possible inference and minimal memory and computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "lightweight inference: ideal for on‑device or low‑resource deployment.\n",
    "Safe feature extraction: Can use BERT purely as a static embedding generator and train external classifiers separately.\n",
    "Since nothing is getting updated, no pretrained knowledge will be lost.\n",
    "\n",
    "Training: \n",
    "\n",
    "None. Can only do inference or use BERT as a static feature extractor.\n",

    "No risk of overfitting or catastrophic forgetting.\n",
    "Zero GPU cost for gradient computation.\n",

    "Advantages:\n",

    "Parameter efficiency: Only train parameters in each head, which is tiny compared to fintuning the entire BERT + heads.\n",

    "3.One Head Frozen, Backbone & Other Head Trainable\n",

    "Implications:\n",
    "\n",
    "Adapt BERT to better serve the unfrozen task, while preserving the frozen head’s original mapping.\n",
    "As BERT gtting updated, the frozen head’s inputs shift, which can degrade its performance.\n",
    "Intermediate compute cost: you still backprop through most of BERT but skip one head.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "Task isolation: if one task has abundant data and you want to improve it without touching the other, you can freeze the weaker‑data head.\n",
    "Transfer learning flexibility: you can “stack” tasks sequentially—e.g., first fine‑tune for NER, then freeze NER head and fine‑tune for classification.\n",
    "Balanced resource use: you don’t pay the full cost of two‑head training, yet still adapt the shared encoder.\n",

    "\n",
    "Freeze BERT plus one task head(NER head).\n",
    "Train the other head (sentence classification) and optionally the top few BERT layers.\n",

    "Rationale:\n",
    "\n",
    "Sequential task addition: you’ve already fine‑tuned NER on a large dataset and want to add a small sentence‐classification dataset without disturbing NER.\n",

    " 1.The choice of a pre-trained model.\n",
    " \n",
    " If the task if not domain specific, we can start with a strong, widely used base model such as bert-base-uncased, roberta-base, or deberta-v3-base. However, if the task is domain specific, let's say clinical data, search for a public variant that’s already been further pre‑trained on that domain.\n",

    " If there is not time and resource contraints, of course we can fintune the entire model. However, that is rarely the case, so the smartest option to start with is to freeze the backbone(most amount of params), and train the heads, with minimal compute. If the fintuning result is not ideal, or the pretrained backbone is not aligning well with the heads, consider unfreezing the top layers, so the model learn more task specific deatails without updating or forgetting its core knowedge. The last option is to unfreeze and retrain the entire model, but that requires a huge dataset and a lot of computing resource.\n",

    " 3.Rationale Behind These Choices\n",

    "Catastrophic Forgetting Mitigation:\n",
    "Starting with frozen weights preserves the pretrained knowledge. Gradual unfreezing prevents large destructive updates.\n",

    "Data Efficiency:\n",
    "Small datasets can’t support training ~100 M parameters. By training heads first, you only update a few thousand weights.\n",

    "Compute & Time Savings:\n",
    "Frozen layers skip gradient computations, reducing GPU memory and speeding up iterations in early phases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Domain Adaptation:\n",
    "If you can, pick a domain‑adapted checkpoint so your “Phase 1” features are already well‑aligned—heads learn faster and generalize better.\n",
    "\n",
    "Layer‑wise Specialization:\n",
    "Lower Transformer layers capture universal language features; upper layers capture more task‑specific semantics. Freezing the bottom layers retains generality, unfreezing the top layers focuses adaptation where it’s most effective.\n",
